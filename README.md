The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced educators to take an online approach to education. There has been a boom in the use of online resources. Online classes along with other online resources are now a part of every student's life. One of the most important online resources available to students is educational videos. These can be found on YouTube and other sites or be recordings of a lecturer.

The following are the various issues/problems with online educational videos:
- Students tend to space out when the video is long and the concepts taught are tedious.
- There is no feedback loop to check what a student understands after he watches the video.
- The videos are mostly in English or Hindi and some of them don’t have closed captions. This poses a language barrier for people from parts of India who don’t speak either of the languages.
- Students have to manually take notes while listening to the video.

Drona (a browser extension) will be a solution to all these problems and be a great help to students. It will help them surmount these difficult times and forge ahead with their education.
